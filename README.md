Hi! My Name is Jose.

I am a dedicated software engineer from Brazil. I spent 10 years as a teacher working with school reinforcement aided by computers before starting my transition into software development in 2017. Driven by a passion for enhancing children's learning experiences, I began by mastering MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript to create interactive educational games (puzzles).

In 2018, I started to develop a comprehensive ERP: a School Management System (SMS) with Laravel. This system was designed to generate detailed reports on children's learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses, providing valuable insights for teachers.

By early 2019, I started enhancing the SMS interface, still in Laravel, with Vue.js, and creating games with Vue, React, and Angular. This year, I started developing Unity games in C#, but the results were less satisfactory than programming with React: the games should be very lightweight and run on very old computers.

In 2020 my worries about children's data inside this application led me to learn website security and use Spring (with Angular) and AWS to elevate the School Management System to a robust and secure platform. At the same time, I delved into Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io to transform my interactive games into multiplayer experiences. In the last half of 2020, I delved into Python, specifically Flask and Django, to streamline the SMS features development process and started to use Flask to create the APIs for reports, but...

In the middle of 2020, I suffered from severe depression. This period of my life will last two and a half years, and during this, I just can't get productive at all with programming. I felt that nothing I had made was sufficiently good, and even the previous works were not worth using. On the other side, I have no idea how, but I could focus on my studies and finish two graduations. My depression was finally under control in the middle of 2023, after lots of days with help from family and friends and the right treatment.

"Back to life", in late 2023, I started two new projects: a set of minigames to teach digital literacy to adults using MERN and socket.io and a new ERP: a Social Assistance Management System (SAMS), again with Spring and Angular at AWS. I also start refactoring the two ERPs in C# and Blazor to host them in Azure.
