Ah, the memories! Cast your mind back to the days when :floppy_disk: <b>BASIC</b>, :floppy_disk: <b>Pascal</b>, and :floppy_disk: <b>Clipper</b> held sway as the formidable languages of the time.

But lo and behold, there exists another facet of my being, one that resonates with the ethereal :sparkles: <b>realm of art</b>. Ah, the power to :anger: <b>stir emotions</b>, to captivate the senses!
