Hi! My Name is Jose.

I am a dedicated software engineer from Brazil. I spent 10 years as a teacher working with school reinforcement aided by computers before starting my transition into software development in 2017. Driven by a passion for enhancing children's learning experiences, I began by mastering MySQL, PHP, and JavaScript to create interactive educational games (puzzles).

In 2018, I started to develop a comprehensive ERP: a School Management System (SMS) with Laravel. This system was designed to generate detailed reports on children's learning styles, strengths, and weaknesses, providing valuable insights for teachers.

By early 2019, I started enhancing the SMS interface, still in Laravel, with Vue.js, and creating games with Vue, React, and Angular. This year, I started developing Unity games in C#, but the results were less satisfactory than programming with React: the games should be very lightweight and run on very old computers.

In 2020 my worries about children's data inside this application led me to learn website security and use Spring (with Angular) and AWS to elevate the School Management System to a robust and secure platform. At the same time, I delved into Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Socket.io to transform my interactive games into multiplayer experiences. In the last half of 2020, I delved into Python, specifically Flask and Django, to streamline the SMS features development process and started to use Flask to create the APIs for reports, but...

In the middle of 2020, due to the difficulty of finding a job as a developer without a higher education degree (in the field), I decided to focus on my studies and finish two Associate Degrees: Graphic Design and Information Technology in Systems Analysis and Development, as well some Postgraduate diplomas. So, for almost three years, I was unproductive here in GitHub but very productive in other places.

"Back to life", in late 2023, I started two new projects: a set of minigames to teach digital literacy to adults using MERN and socket.io and a new ERP: a Social Assistance Management System (SAMS), again with Spring and Angular at AWS. I also start refactoring the two ERPs in C# and Blazor to host them in Azure.
